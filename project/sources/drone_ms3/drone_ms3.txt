### DRONE NAME: drone_ms3
The implementation of this drone was done considering the work done regarding the first assignment.

The drone is totally randomly driven in fact we have definedd:
- randomePos() that alculates the offset on the axis to move randomly;
- randomStep() that calculates the number of times the drone has to move in a certain direction randomly;
- randomVel() that calculates the velocity of the drone randomly.
- sign() that calcualtes if the position has to be increased or decreased.

In the main function, after connecting to the server, there is a control on the spawn of the position, in particualr:
- if the drone was given a position then the program checks that this is available, so there is not another drone already placed here or there is not a wall;
- if the drone was not given a position then the program computes it randomly and checks again the availability.
Once finished the drone can start moving.

The drone is equipped with a battery that allows it to move for 100 steps at maximum before recharging, after that it has to land and recharge it.
The drone computes randomly the amount of steps to do before changing the direction.
Given that the drone can also move along the z axis, it has been implemented a control on the battery with respect to the height of the drone from the ground (0 level) so that to be sure that the drone will have enough battery to land.
Once the drone lands, the battery is recharged.

Inside the execution of the drone there are some different prints that allow the user know the general state of the drone, what is its behaviour and were it is going.
To simplify it and in order to make it clearer it has been developed a map that keeps into account the position occupied by the drone:
since the difficult to implement 3D view, we opted for a 2D in which we do not take case about the z axis.
The general legend of the map is:

- (in yellow) for position not visited yet;
V (in green) for position already visited;
X (in white) for position of the walls;
O (in blue) for position of the drone in real time. 

The program ends with a function that frees all the resources.
